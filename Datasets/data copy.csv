1,english,A Dynamic Study between Export from China to South Korea and Economic Growth in China,"This paper applies annual data from 1998 to 2016 to search for the dynamic operating mechanism between export from China to South Korea and economic growth in China. The vector error correction model is utilized to conduct an empirical analysis. The results indicate that there is a long-run relationship between them. In more specifically, if the export from China to South Korea increases by 1 per cent, the economic growth in China will increases by 0.769 per cent. Meanwhile, the result of Granger causality test also reveals that there is an unidirectional causality between them exists under 5 per cent significance level. More importantly, the result of vector error correction mechanism shows that when the economic growth is derivate from the long-run equilibrium in the short run, it will return to the long-run equilibrium by 2.2 percent.",FE,Jurnal Ekonomi dan Studi Pembangunan

7,english,MULTI-INPUT TRANSFER FUNCTION MODEL IN FORECASTING MALANG CITY HOTEL TAX REVENUE IN 2019,"A transfer function is one of the models contained in the time series. The multi-input transfer function is used to establish a simple model derived from the relationship between input and output series. The transfer function model will be applied to the forecasting of hotel tax revenue (Y) into an output series with the input series variables affected by the number of sold rooms (X^a), the number of staying guests (X^b), and the average of the guest’s staying time (X^c). The purpose of this study is to anticipate the failure of the realization of the hotel tax revenue target in Malang City and to determine the results of the next forecasting. The result of this study is the multi-input transfer function, Y_t = Y_(t-1) + 0.0052294*X^b_(t-8) + 573.32180*X^c_t - 0.0052294*X^b_(t-9) - 573.32180*X^c_(t-1) + 1.18967*a_t. Based on this function, the forecasting nearly coincides with the actual data indicated by the graph of forecasting result nearly coincides with the graph of the actual data. Thus, this multi-input transfer function could be suggested to be used in forecasting Malang City hotel tax revenues from January 2019 to May 2019.",FMIPA,Jurnal Kajian Matematika dan Aplikasinya (JKMA)
